Chronic_Kidney_Disease_Prediction-Machine-Learning-

In this project, we pre-processed and analyzed the Chronic Kidney Disease dataset from Kaggle using a variety of machine learning classifiers to predict disease status accurately. We handled missing data, standardized features, and encoded categorical variables to optimize model performance. Multiple models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Classifier, were trained and evaluated. 
Ensemble techniques like Voting Classifier were implemented to combine predictions for improved accuracy. This approach provided insights into key features and yielded robust predictions for chronic kidney disease risk.
